## Ruby Installfest

These are the instructions for installing Ruby, a text editor, and practicing using the command line. This should be completed as part of the homework after Class 1.

### Installing Ruby

We will use the first part of the Railsbridge Installfest instructions to install Ruby. Please be sure to read the instructions for each step before copying & pasting commands in your terminal. 

[Ruby Installfest Instructions](http://docs.railsbridge.org/installfest/choose_your_operating_system)

**Start with**: *Choose Your Operating System* 
**End at the step right before**: 
- (Mac) Step #8: *Install Rails*
- (Windows) Step #7 *Update Rails*

### Download & Install a Text Editor

A text editor is used for writing code. You can use any of the following, all of which are free to download.

[SublimeText (recommended)](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

[Atom](https://atom.io/)

### Practice Using the Command Line

The Django Girls website has a great tutorial on using common commands on the command line:

[Django Girls Intro to Command Line](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/)

Youâ€™ll be using some of these commands in class when you start coding! It helps to get familiar with some common commands before we start. You just need to go through the **Intro to Command Line** page since the rest is for the python programming language.
